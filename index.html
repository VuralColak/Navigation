        <h1>Strong Solar Flare Erupts from Sun</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The Sun emitted a strong solar flare on Tuesday, May 10, 2022, peaking at 9:55 a.m. EDT. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun constantly, captured an image of the event.</p>
        <img src="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/wp-content/uploads/sites/304/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-10-at-10.30.38-AM-768x649.png" alt="sun">
        <p>Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.
          <br><br>
          This flare is classified as an X-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.

          <h1>NASA to Provide Update on InSight Mars Lander</h1>
          <br>
          <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/1-pia23203-insight_selfie_already_in_pj.png?itok=3hMxPuoK" alt="mars">
          <br>
          <p>NASA will hold a media teleconference at 2 p.m. EDT (11 a.m. PDT) on Tuesday, May 17, to provide an update on the agency’s InSight Mars lander. NASA leadership and mission team members will highlight InSight’s science accomplishments, share details on the spacecraft’s power situation, and discuss its future.
            <br><br>
            The teleconference participants will include:
            <ul class="mars-list">
            <li>Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington</li>
            <li>Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California</li>
            <li>Kathya Zamora Garcia, InSight deputy project manager, JPL</li>
            <br><br>
            To participate in the call, media must RSVP no later than three hours prior to the start of the event to Rexana Vizza at: rexana.v.vizza@jpl.nasa.gov. Valid media credentials are required and the agency’s media accreditation policy is available online. Media and the public can submit questions on social media during the teleconference using #AskNASA.
            <br><br>
            InSight landed in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars in November 2018 with the goal of studying the planet’s deep interior for the first time, using seismic signals to learn more about the properties of the crust, mantle, and core. Answering these questions helps shed light on how all rocky worlds form, including Earth and its Moon.
            <br><br>
            After InSight met the goals of its two-year-long prime mission, NASA extended the mission until December 2022. However, due to dust accumulation on its solar panels, InSight’s electrical power production is dropping, and the mission is unlikely to continue operations for the duration of its current extended mission unless its solar panels are cleared by a passing “dust devil” in Mars’ atmosphere.
