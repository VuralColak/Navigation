        <h1>Strong Solar Flare Erupts from Sun</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The Sun emitted a strong solar flare on Tuesday, May 10, 2022, peaking at 9:55 a.m. EDT. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun constantly, captured an image of the event.</p>
        <img src="https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/wp-content/uploads/sites/304/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-10-at-10.30.38-AM-768x649.png" alt="sun">
        <p>Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.
          <br><br>
          This flare is classified as an X-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength.

          <h1>NASA to Provide Update on InSight Mars Lander</h1>
          <br>
          <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/1-pia23203-insight_selfie_already_in_pj.png?itok=3hMxPuoK" alt="mars">
          <br>
          <p>NASA will hold a media teleconference at 2 p.m. EDT (11 a.m. PDT) on Tuesday, May 17, to provide an update on the agency’s InSight Mars lander. NASA leadership and mission team members will highlight InSight’s science accomplishments, share details on the spacecraft’s power situation, and discuss its future.
            <br><br>
            The teleconference participants will include:
            
            Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington
            <br><br>
            Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California
            <br><br>
            Kathya Zamora Garcia, InSight deputy project manager, JPL
            <br><br>
            To participate in the call, media must RSVP no later than three hours prior to the start of the event to Rexana Vizza at: rexana.v.vizza@jpl.nasa.gov. Valid media credentials are required and the agency’s media accreditation policy is available online. Media and the public can submit questions on social media during the teleconference using #AskNASA.
            <br><br>
            InSight landed in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars in November 2018 with the goal of studying the planet’s deep interior for the first time, using seismic signals to learn more about the properties of the crust, mantle, and core. Answering these questions helps shed light on how all rocky worlds form, including Earth and its Moon.
            <br><br>
            After InSight met the goals of its two-year-long prime mission, NASA extended the mission until December 2022. However, due to dust accumulation on its solar panels, InSight’s electrical power production is dropping, and the mission is unlikely to continue operations for the duration of its current extended mission unless its solar panels are cleared by a passing “dust devil” in Mars’ atmosphere.

          <h1>NASA’s SpaceX Crew-3 to Discuss Mission After Returning to Earth</h1>
          <br><br>
          <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/iss067e022576.jpeg?itok=c4KjX5eM" alt="astronaut">
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Astronauts of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-3 mission, including crew members from NASA and ESA (European Space Agency), will answer questions about their recent mission aboard the International Space Station during a post-splashdown news conference at 11:45 a.m. EDT Wednesday, May 11. The event will air live on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website.
            <br><br>
            NASA astronauts Kayla Barron, Raja Chari and Tom Marshburn, as well as ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, will participate in this first media event following their splashdown. The Crew-3 astronauts also will participate in a Facebook Live on the NASA Astronauts’ Facebook page at 10:50 a.m. ahead of the news conference.
            <br><br>
            Reporters who wish to participate must RSVP to the newsroom at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston at: jsccommu@mail.nasa.gov or 281-483-5111 no later than 9:45 a.m. Wednesday, May 11 to receive dial-in information. To ask questions, reporters must dial into the news conference no later than 11:40 a.m. Those following the briefing on social media may ask questions using #AskNASA.
            <br><br>
            Barron, Chari, Marshburn, and Maurer, returned to Earth in a parachute-assisted splashdown in SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft Endurance at 12:43 a.m. Friday, May 6, off the coast of Florida. After returning to shore, the astronauts flew back to Houston, where they were greeted by their families and colleagues.
            <br><br>
            Crew-3 astronauts traveled 75,060,792 miles during their 177 days in orbit (175 of which were spent aboard the International Space Station). They completed 2,832 orbits around Earth. During their science expedition aboard the orbiting laboratory, the Crew-3 astronauts conducted experiments, including a study on concrete hardening in microgravity, research on cotton varieties that could help develop drought-resistant plants, and executed a space archaeology study that could provide information that contributes to the design of future space habitats.
            <br><br>
            They tested new life support technology, installed new combustion research hardware, and talked to thousands of students during dozens of amateur radio contacts. Working in pairs, the astronauts also completed four spacewalks to prepare the station for upcoming solar array upgrades by assembling and installing modification kits and successfully replacing a faulty antenna on the Port-1 truss structure.
            <br><br>
            This was the third flight of a NASA-certified commercial human spacecraft flown as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, and the fourth crewed flight to the space station aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.
